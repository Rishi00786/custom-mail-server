## Setup Guide üöÄ

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (recommended version 16+ or latest LTS)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A MySQL database (cloud service recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone Rishi00786/custom-mail-server
   ```
   Alternatively, download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your database URL:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=<Your_Database_URL>
   ```
   Replace `<Your_Database_URL>` with the connection string of your MySQL database.

4. **Set Up the Database**
   Run the following commands to initialize and inspect your database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma studio
   ```
   - **`npx prisma generate`**: Generates the Prisma client for database access.
   - **`npx prisma db push`**: Synchronizes the Prisma schema with your database.
   - **`npx prisma studio`**: Opens a web-based interface to explore your database.

5. **Start the Development Server**
   Launch the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

# Security Features

This custom mail server prioritizes security at every stage of its functionality. Below is a summary of the key security features implemented:

## 1. JWT Authentication
- Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
- Tokens are signed and validated to ensure that only authorized users can access protected routes.

## 2. Password Hashing
- User passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage, ensuring that sensitive data is never stored in plain text.

## 3. Secure Email Transmission
- Email sending is secured using SSL/TLS encryption via nodemailer to prevent unencrypted email transmission.

## 4. Role-based Authorization
- AuthGuard ensures that only users with a valid JWT token can access specific routes like sending emails or fetching inbox data.

## 5. Email Credentials Security
- Email services use app-specific passwords (e.g., for Gmail) rather than user account passwords to improve security.

## 6. Secure IMAP Email Fetching
- IMAP email fetching uses TLS encryption to securely connect to email servers.

## 7. Custom Error Handling
- The application uses structured error handling (e.g., UnauthorizedException, BadRequestException) to prevent exposing sensitive stack traces.

## 8. Sensitive Data Protection
- All sensitive user information (such as passwords and email credentials) is securely handled and not exposed in logs or error messages.

## 9. Unique User Registration
- During user registration, the application checks for unique emails to prevent duplicate accounts.

## 10. Data Integrity
- Input validation is used to ensure the integrity of user data, particularly in email-related fields (to, subject, body).
